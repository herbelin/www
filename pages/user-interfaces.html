Coq projects can be developed with a variety of <strong>editors</strong> thanks to
great support provided through user-contributed extensions.  Here, we
list such support extensions that are actively used and maintained:

<ul>

<li>
  <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and <strong>VSCodium</strong> users can use
 the <a href="https://github.com/coq-community/vscoq/tree/vscoq1">VsCoq 1
extension</a>, which is maintained by several contributors as part
    of <a href="https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto">coq-community</a>.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Emacs</strong> users can use the major Coq
mode <a href="https://proofgeneral.github.io/">Proof General</a>, that
can be extended by the minor Coq
mode <a href="https://github.com/cpitclaudel/company-coq">Company-Coq</a>.
Proof General was one of the first user interface for proof
assistants. See e.g.
<a href="https://proofgeneral.github.io/doc/master/userman/Coq-Proof-General/">here</a>
for an excerpt of Coq-specific features.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Vim/NeoVim</strong> users can use the
<a href="https://github.com/whonore/Coqtail">Coqtail</a>
extension.  This extension is partly based upon a previous, and now
unmaintained, Vim extension
called <a href="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/coquille">Coquille</a>.
</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
Otherwise, <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/coqide.html">CoqIDE</a> is
a <strong>stand-alone</strong> interface
developed and distributed alongside Coq.
CoqIDE comes with standard basic Emacs-like edition bindings
and with some specific Coq-related features (e.g. for searching, printing, debugging) but, as an editor, it is
not as complete as a general-purpose editor could be (for instance it
does not have automatic indentation).
</p>

<p>
As a way to try Coq without installing anything, you can also
use <a href="https://jscoq.github.io/">JsCoq</a> which loads Coq
entirely in <strong>your browser</strong>.  However, it is limited to conduct
actual projects: e.g., it lacks access to the VM and native computing
machineries of Coq, and running in the browser is slower.

<div class="framework">
<div class="frameworklabel">Towards a modular design of Coq user interfaces based on the LSP protocol</div>
<div class="frameworkcontent">
  The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol">Language
        Server Protocol</a> (LSP) is a standard protocol for interfacing
        IDEs and programming language tools. Two interfaces, each composed of a VS Code
        client and of a Coq server communicating over a proof-assistant-specific
        extension of LSP are at an experimental stage of development:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/coq-community/vscoq">VsCoq 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp">coq-lsp</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Both provides the ability of continuous and asynchronous document
  checking as well as position-based document navigation (an
  interaction model introduced in Wenzel's Isabelle/JEdit which
  departs from the model of splitting the buffer into a validated zone
  and an unvalidated zone, as found in other Coq user interfaces; see
  e.g. this <a href="https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp/blob/main/etc/FAQ.md">FAQ</a>
  for more information, where in the text, "coq-lsp" should be read as
  "coq-lsp or VsCoq 2" and "VsCoq" should be read as "VsCoq 1").
  </p>
  <p>
  The features provided by the two servers are available to any
  editor implementing the protocol, e.g. Emacs, Vim, jsCoq, or even another
  VS Code client. In turn, any new feature eventually added to the
  servers becomes available for integration by their clients.

Here are some
additional user interfaces that have stayed at the experimental level
or whose maintenance has either been discontinued or is currently
uncertain:
<ul>
<li> A <a href="https://github.com/EugeneLoy/coq_jupyter/">Jupyter kernel
for Coq</a> is available if you want to try this interface, for
instance for pedagogical or readability purposes.  One of the
advantages of using a Jupyter notebook is that you can save and
display a selection of intermediate proof steps, which your reader
will see without the need to reexecute the document.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://coqoon.github.io/">Coqoon</a> Eclipse plugin was
initially based upon
the discontinued <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/src/PIDEtop/">PIDEtop
Coq plugin</a> (following Wenzel's asynchronous PIDE framework and using the
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/dev/doc/xml-protocol.md">Coq's
XML protocol for IDEs</a>).
</li>
<li>
The <a href="https://github.com/Ptival/PeaCoq">PeaCoq</a> online web
interface for Coq was focused on teaching (actively developed from
2014 to 2016).
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://prover.cs.ru.nl">ProofWeb</a> online web interface
for Coq (and other proof assistants) was also focused on teaching (in
2006-2007).
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://provereditor.gforge.inria.fr">ProverEditor</a> was an
experimental Eclipse plugin with support for Coq (in 2005-2006).
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq/">Pcoq</a> (discontinued
in 2003) was a first experiment at <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/croap/ctcoq/help/pbp.html">proof-by-pointing</a>.
